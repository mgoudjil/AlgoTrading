AI-based cryptocurrency algorithmic trading system

Cryptocurrencies have recently received increasing attention in the fields of finance and computer science. Likewise, the application of machine learning techniques have shown successful in cryptocurrency price forecasting. 

In this project, we investigate the prediction performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for directional price movement, based on technical, fundamental and social indicators (Sentiment Analysis) for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Subsequently, we build an hourly trading algorithmic strategy based on the best-in class prediction performances. Obtained results suggest the MLP outperforms both SVM and the LSTM for directional price movement predictions. Highest prediction performances are, moreover, achieved through the combination of different trading indicators. Finally, our trading algorithm outperforms the classic buy-and-hold benchmark strategy on absolute and risk-adjusted performance metrics.
